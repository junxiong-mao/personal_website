        <p>&nbsp &nbsp My name is <b>Junxiong Mao</b>, also David Mao. I am a passionate computer programmer who is keen on developing software. I am now pursuing my CS master degree in <b>University of California, San Diego</b>. I got my Electrical and Computer Engineering bachelor degree in <b>Shanghai Jiao Tong Univeristy</b>, UM-SJTU Joint Institute, where I learned most of the basic Computer Science courses, including C++ Object-oriented Programming, Algorithms, Data Structures, Operating Systems, Databases, etc. I also spent one spring semester in <b>The University of Hong Kong</b>, where I learned Functional Programming and Distributed Systems.</p>

        <p>&nbsp &nbsp I ever worked in <b>Intel Corporation</b> (Shanghai) as a software engineer intern. I developed a web application which could monitor sensor status on the server board, and designed asynchronous algorithms to show real-time data on the front-end.<br />
        &nbsp &nbsp Although I have not decided my future concentration in Computer Science yet, I am very enthusiastic about software implementation. I prefer system level development. I will focus more on this area in the future.</p>
